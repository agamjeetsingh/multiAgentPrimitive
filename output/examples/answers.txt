AI's Answer: <Detailed reasoning>
The first missing part should be the definition of the perpendiculars, so $\angle AXM = \angle MPC = 90^{\circ}$, which is expression 1. The second missing part should introduce ratios using similar triangles $\triangle AXM \sim \triangle MPC$, which would relate sides in the equation: $\frac{MP}{MX} = \frac{MC}{MA}$. However, the given expression 2 includes extra terms. So it would have to be expression 2. The third missing part is that $MC=MB$ since M is the midpoint of BC, which is expression 3. The fourth missing part should state $NB=NC$ using the power of a point.  This is expression 4. The fifth missing part states the line segment XQ, which is expression 5. The sixth missing part establishes $NB=NC$ from being on the perpendicular bisector, so it must be expression 4. The last missing part concerns the perpendicular bisector of which line segment N lies on. Since M is the midpoint of both BC and XQ and the perpendicular bisector passes through M, we should use $\overline{XQ}$ here which is represented by expression 5.

AI's Answer: <Detailed reasoning>
The first missing tag, <missing 1>, appears in the phrase "In the next <missing 1> columns...". Given that the first column is already accounted for, and the solution discusses filling the remaining columns with vertical dominos, we need to determine how many columns are used for these vertical domino placements. Since each column has `n` cells and vertical dominoes occupy 2 cells, the number of vertical dominoes per column is (n-1)/2. The number of columns, excluding the first column, will thus also be given by this expression. So <missing 1> is (n-1)/2, which matches expression 2. Similarly, for <missing 2>, the text states "...place <missing 2> vertically oriented dominos in a row starting from the top". Following similar logic as before, the number of vertically oriented dominos in each of the (n-1)/2 columns is (n-1)/2, so this matches expression 2 as well.

AI's Answer: <Detailed reasoning>
The first missing tag <missing 1> is in the context of "Case 2" where it describes when $v_2(a) \neq 0$. The only relevant formula in the list that fits this case is when $v_2(a) = 1$, i.e., expression 4. The second missing tag <missing 2> describes the result of Alice's move, adding $a$ to $n$ which is represented by $n'= n+a$, or expression 1. The third missing tag <missing 3> is in the context of the general case, which refers to the condition that the game can last indefinitely when $v_2(n) < v_2(a)$ which is expression 3. The fourth missing tag <missing 4> is a continuation of the "only if" part of the general case, stating the contrapositive condition, which is again $v_2(n) < v_2(a)$ for all n, i.e. expression 3.

AI's Answer: <Detailed reasoning>
The problem asks for values of n for which row-valid arrangements can be transformed into column-valid ones. The solution uses the fact that if n is prime, then we can use roots of unity to show the desired property. Let's map the missing tags to the provided expressions.
<missing 1>: The answer is stated to be when n is a prime, which corresponds to expression 6.
<missing 2>:  The proof starts with the assumption that n is prime, denoted as n=p, which corresponds to expression 7.
<missing 3>: The variable for the least term of the arithmetic progression in row $i$ is $a_i$, which is expression 2.
<missing 4>: The variable for the common difference of the arithmetic progression in row $i$ is $d_i$, which corresponds to expression 1.
<missing 5>: The solution assigns each cell with an integer k to the monomial $x^k$, matching expression 4.
<missing 6>: The solution mentions that when $x$ is a $p$-th root of unity that is not $1$, it vanishes, which corresponds to expression 8.
<missing 7>: The expression $f(x)$ represents the sum $\sum_{p \mid d_i} x^{a_i \pmod{p}}$ which corresponds to expression 3.
<missing 8>: The solution states that $1 + x + ... + x^{p-1}$ is a factor of, which is expression 5.
<missing 9>: This is the expression for the polynomial, which is given by expression 9.

The problem asks for which values of $n \ge 3$ can a row-valid arrangement of $1,2,\dots, n^2$ be transformed into a column-valid arrangement by permuting the rows. The solution proves that primes work and composites do not. We need to match the missing tags to the given latex expressions.
<missing 1> is the answer which is stated to be when n is prime, which corresponds to expression 15.
<missing 2> should say n is prime which corresponds to expression 3.
<missing 3> is the least term of the arithmetic progression of the i-th row, which is $a_i$ and corresponds to expression 14.
<missing 4> is the monomial assigned to each cell with integer k, which is $x^k$ and corresponds to expression 4.
<missing 5> represents the sum of monomials over each row that has $p | d_i$, which is $f(x) := \sum_{p \mid d_i} x^{a_i \pmod{p}} = 0$, corresponding to expression 5.
<missing 6> is the total sum of monomials over each row,  which is $\sum_{i=1}^n x^{a_i}(1+x^{d_i}+\ldots+x^{(n-1)d_i})$ which equals $x(1+x+...+x^{n^2-1})$ corresponding to expression 6.
<missing 7> is the reduced exponents when $p|d_i$ which is $\sum_{p \mid d_i} x^{a_i}$, corresponding to expression 7.
<missing 8> refers to a condition about common difference $d$, and given the context should be $d < ab = n$ which matches expression 8.
<missing 9> is the polynomial given by $\prod_{s \in S} (x-s)=1+x+\ldots+x^{p-1}$ which corresponds to expression 9.
<missing 10>  refers to n being composite when n=ab matching expression 10.
<missing 11> refers to the common difference being greater than ab, given by expression 11.
<missing 12> refers to term that must be in the column with common difference $ab$, specifically it is $a^2b -ab$, the first term - common difference given in the text, and equals $a^2b+ab-2d = a^2b - ab$ so corresponds to expression 12.
<missing 13> should be $a^2b+ab-d$ which is equal to $a^2b$ in this context, but $a^2b + ab - d = a^2b$ should corresponds to expression 13
<missing 14> refers to a specific term in the row, $a^2b + ab - d$, which in the text it just refers to an arbitrary element and should be the initial term $a_i$, so it should be expression 14.
<missing 15> refers to a common difference, and in context it means when n is prime, which has been written down to represent $\boxed{\text{prime } n}$, so it should be 15.
<missing 16> refers to the residue of each element in the column being $i\pmod{p}$ which matches 16.
<missing 17> is the common difference when it is $ab=n$, and should be expression 17.
<missing 18> is the term with p added i-1 times which is $1 + (i-1)p$ and corresponds to expression 18.
<missing 19> refers to the term next to $a^2b+ab-d$, which is $a^2b+ab$ which matches expression 19.
<missing 20> refers to a constraint, which states $f(x)$, and thus corresponds to 20.

AI's Answer: Okay, let's analyze the provided solution and match the missing tags with the given formulas.

1.  **`<missing 1>`**: This refers to the final answer, which was determined to be the pair `(m, m-1)`. This is given in `<expression 2>`.

2.  **`<missing 2>`**: This refers to the condition required to make the proof work which is `m <= n + 1`. This is given in `<expression 9>`.

3.  **`<missing 3>`**: This is an example with $m=5$ and $n=4$, which is a specific example of when $m = n+1$. The text mentions $B_1$ etc so it should use the example where we add the blue beads and that is `<expression 13>`. However, as this is one of the earlier states and not the general form I will guess `<expression 15>`. It looks to be $n=4$ so it should be that.

4.  **`<missing 4>`**: This describes a matrix arrangement with rows and $n$ columns.  This is $m=n+1$. This is given in `<expression 15>`. The text references $T$ and says four blue beads are moved, and they are called $B_1$ to $B_4$ so I am still going with `<expression 15>`. Let's guess `<expression 13>`. I was wrong again. It looks like a description of the necklace. I am going to guess `<expression 20>`.

5. **`<missing 5>`**: This refers to the label of a bead, which is $B_1$. This is `<expression 3>`.
6.  **`<missing 6>`**: This is also a label of a bead, which would logically be $B_n$. This is given in `<expression 16>`.
7.  **`<missing 7>`**: This refers to an equation for $n$. This is $n=4$, but the given one is $n=7$. It is given as $T_0$ in `<expression 14>` which is what we are looking at when we do the cuts. I'm going to guess `<expression 7>`.

8.  **`<missing 8>`**: The first cut is $T_0$. This is given in `<expression 14>`.

9. **`<missing 9>`**: The second cut is $T_1$. This is given in `<expression 20>`.

10. **`<missing 10>`**: The next cut is $T_2$. This is given in `<expression 12>`.

11. **`<missing 11>`**: The cuts are until we reach $T_{n-1}$. This is `<expression 24>`.
12. **`<missing 12>`**: The text says $T_i$ differs from this by having cuts one bead later, which means it is $T_{i-1}$, but the example uses $T_2$, so it should be $T_2$. This is `<expression 12>`.
13. **`<missing 13>`**: This gives an example of what $T_0$ is. This is given in `<expression 13>`.
14. **`<missing 14>`**:  The table is counting the red beads in $T_i$ for each $k$. The example provided is for $T_0$ so this is `<expression 14>`.
15. **`<missing 15>`**: The number of red beads in the $k$th row of $T_i$. The text refers to the st row so it must be using the index $k$ which is $1 \le k \le n+1$. This is given in `<expression 21>`.
16.  **`<missing 16>`**: This is a table of values for number of red cells, which is represented in `<expression 1>`.
17. **`<missing 17>`**: The explicit formula refers to the ($i$, $k$)th cell and lists the possible values of $k$. This is given in `<expression 17>`.
18.  **`<missing 18>`**: This is the explicit formula for the number of red beads in the $k$-th row of $T_i$. This is given in `<expression 4>`.
19. **`<missing 19>`**: This is what the counts are from bottom to top. Since we are counting 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 from bottom to top it must be k+1 since k starts at 0. So the counts are the numbers from $0$ to $n$. So they are in order $k+1$. This is given in `<expression 19>`.

20. **`<missing 20>`**: Construction for $m < n+1$ starts with a construction with $m=n+1$. The example is $T_1$. This is `<expression 20>`.
21. **`<missing 21>`**: This gives the range of $k$ for use in the formula, which is from 1 to n+1. This is given in `<expression 21>`.

22. **`<missing 22>`**: Example of $m$ where $m=n+1$. This is given in `<expression 8>`.
23. **`<missing 23>`**: The construction uses the cut $T_{i-1}$. This is given in `<expression 23>`.
24. **`<missing 24>`**:  This shows the construction for $m<n+1$, which is constructed using the cuts $T_{n-1}$. The expression is given in `<expression 6>`.

AI's Answer: Okay, let's analyze the provided solution and the available expressions to fill in the missing pieces.

1. **<missing 1>**: The first blank is in the context of completing an isosceles trapezoid $ABQC$.  Expression 6 states that $D \in \bar{AQ}$, which implies that we are dealing with a trapezoid with base $AB$ and is part of the construction itself. Thus, 6 seems the correct choice.

2. **<missing 2>**: The solution then reflects B across E to F and claims that DQCF is cyclic. We are going to need an expression that relates to the fact that $AE = EC$ and establishes that $DQCF$ is cyclic. Expression 1,  $EA = EC$, is crucial to establish some angle equalities, and is thus the best match for this blank.

3. **<missing 3>**: Immediately after claiming that we have $EA = EC$, the solution states that <missing 3> as line QF is the image of the perpendicular bisector. Expression 2, $\overline{QF} \perp \overline{AC}$, fits this context perfectly as we are claiming that QF is perpendicular to AC based on the previous statement about E being the midpoint and how the points were constructed in the first step. Thus, we fill in 2.

4. **<missing 4>**: We just claimed that $\overline{QF} \perp \overline{AC}$ where $\overline{QF}$ is the image of a perpendicular bisector under homothety with B, so we are referring to the perpendicular bisector of segment $AC$. Therefore, expression 3 $\overline{AC}$ is the correct choice.

5. **<missing 5>**: The next part of the solution states <missing 5> = $90^\circ - \angle CAB$. Expression 5, $\angle FDC = -\angle CDB = 180^\circ - (90^\circ + \angle CAB) = 90^\circ - \angle CAB $, correctly describes the angle relationship needed.

6. **<missing 6>**: In the current solution, the next missing part states <missing 6>. The statement before this one was that $\angle FDC = 90^\circ - \angle CAB$. The best fit for this one is expression 6 which is that $D \in \bar{AQ}$.

7. **<missing 7>**: The final step involves angle equalities leading to proving that DQCF is cyclic. Expression 7 gives us the equation $\angle FQC = 90^\circ - \angle QCA = \angle FDC$ which fits the context and helps establish the cyclic quadrilateral $DQCF$ that we are trying to prove.

AI's Answer: Okay, let's break this down step-by-step.
1.  **<missing 1>**: This refers to the final answer for *c*, which is given by **<expression 8>**.
2. **<missing 2>**: This is the left-hand side of the inequality, abbreviated as **<expression 11>**.
3.  **<missing 3>**:  Without loss of generality, we are assuming that the sum of the x_i values is 1, or **<expression 16>**.
4.  **<missing 4>**: This is the rewriting of the sum using indicator functions: **<expression 20>**.
5.  **<missing 5>**:  This is the switched summation version of the previous step, **<expression 5>**.
6. **<missing 6>**: This simplifies to the sum of squares of the newly defined `v_pq`: **<expression 6>**.
7.  **<missing 7>**: This is the newly defined variable `v_pq`, which is **<expression 7>**.
8.  **<missing 8>**: This is the definition of  `v_pq`, which is **<expression 4>**.
9.  **<missing 9>**: The indices are stated to be in the range **<expression 12>**.
10. **<missing 10>**: This is the simplified form of the LHS for the p=q case: **<expression 6>** (repeated). The correct one should be **<expression 10>**.

12. **<missing 12>**: The sum of *v<sub>p,p</sub>* terms is given by **<expression 9>**.
13. **<missing 13>**:  When *p* is not equal to *q*, the term is bounded by QM-AM. The sets are denoted by **<expression 13>**.
14. **<missing 14>**: The result of the QM-AM for the *p* ≠ *q* is **<expression 21>**.
15. **<missing 15>**: The two bounds are combined to get the total bound, **<expression 14>**.
16. **<missing 16>**: Equality occurs when the value of vpp is the same for all p. Thus it should be  **<expression 3>**.
17. **<missing 17>**: Equality also occurs when vpq is the same for all p!=q. Thus it should be **<expression 4>**.
18. **<missing 18>**: The size of A_i needs to be the same for all i, thus it should be **<expression 15>**.
19. **<missing 19>**: The number of subsets is **<expression 18>**.
20. **<missing 20>**: The set over which subsets are formed is **<expression 17>**.
21. **<missing 21>**: The subset size is given by **<expression 1>**.

AI's Answer: <Detailed reasoning>
Okay, let's analyze the missing parts and match them with the provided expressions.

* **<missing 1>**: This refers to the two smallest prime divisors of n, which are p and q with p < q. So, the correct expression would be  `p < q`. The only one that matches this is expression 16. So, 16 goes first.
* **<missing 2>**: This is talking about the powers of p that divide n, so this should be some power of p, i.e.  $p^x$ for some x, so expression 18 seems the most correct here with $p^{x+1}$ or if we take x=0 it is  $p$. So, 18 is the correct option.
* **<missing 3>**: It states "since ... z>q", so the expression here should be a comparison with z, which is a prime different from both q and p, so it should be `z>q`. Expression 3 is exactly that, so 3 fills in <missing 3>.
* **<missing 4>**: This should be "divisible by p^y", so, the most appropriate one seems to be expression 4 since it is of the form $p^y \vert ...$. Thus 4 is the answer.
* **<missing 5>**: This is looking for the smallest divisor of the form $p^x \cdot q^1$, the smallest of these is when x is 0 which would be just q so we should pick expression 21, `q`.
* **<missing 6>**: This refers to the next smallest divisor after $p^x$, it can either be $q$ or another power of $p$. The most appropriate of the list is expression 22, which implies $p^{a-1} \nmid p^a+q$, which makes sense since after p^a we can have q. No other expression fits this context better. Thus the answer is 22.
* **<missing 7>**: The solution is talking about some condition where the property fails. The condition for this is when a is greater than or equal to 2. Thus it is $a\geq 2$, which means expression 12 goes there.
* **<missing 8>**: The next divisor in the sequence would be either q or $p^{a+1}$. In the case of q, it says the condition fails because p^(a-1) does not divide p^a+q. Thus this spot is filled by $p^a$. The expression that matches is 8.
* **<missing 9>**: This refers to the set of divisors before q. The expression that fits here is 9: `{1, p, p^2 ... p^x}`.
* **<missing 10>**: This is for the case that a is greater than or equal to 2, so the expression that fits here is 10, which is $x\geq 2$.
* **<missing 11>**:  It's the next divisor after $p$, i.e. $p^1$. So the next two would be $p^2$ and $q$. We require $p|p^2+q$. If $a=1$, the ordered divisors are 1, p, q.  Then the condition says that $1 | p + q$, and $p | q + n$. Expression 11 is $n/p + n$, which seems like the most reasonable thing to look at. So we select expression 11.
* **<missing 12>**: In the case when the divisors are of the form $1,p,p^2,...,p^a,q,...$, this is when $a\ge 2$, thus it is expression 12
* **<missing 13>**: This is in the case where n is some power of p. The expression that matches here is 13: `n = p^x`.
* **<missing 14>**: This is the condition that is being considered when we start from the smallest divisors of n up to n. The solution states the first three divisors are 1, p and q if n has at least two prime factors. This will mean that the last three divisors will be something like n/q, n/p, n. Thus the expression that goes here is 2: `(n/q, n/p, n)`.
* **<missing 15>**: Here, we are given $a=1$. Thus it is $p^{a-1}=p^0=1$, so the answer is 15.
* **<missing 16>**: This is stating the relationship between p and q. Since p and q are two prime divisors and p is the smallest one, this is simply p < q. So we select expression 16.
* **<missing 17>**: It states that <missing 17> is divisible by p so the expression that should go here is n/p. Thus it is expression 17.
* **<missing 18>**: It says n/p must divide <missing 18>, so since the divisors should be of form p^i, it should be the next power which is $p^{x+1}$ given by expression 18.
* **<missing 19>**: It states that <missing 19> is 1 because a=1, which is the same as saying that  $p^{a-1}=1$. The expression we choose here is 19: $p^{a-1}$.
* **<missing 20>**: This is referring to divisors of $p^x$. These are of the form $1, p, p^2, \ldots$ which is expression 20.
* **<missing 21>**: This states that $p^0 * q^1 = q$. So, we chose expression 21.
* **<missing 22>**: This is referring to the condition that has to fail when a > 1. It also states "since <missing 9> is divisible by <missing 10>, but q is not". Thus, $p^{a-1}$ does not divide $p^a + q$. Thus the expression 22 should be chosen.
* **<missing 23>**: This refers to divisors when n has only two prime factors, which are 1, p, and q. So we pick expression 23: `(1, p, q)`.

AI's Answer: <Detailed reasoning>
The solution aims to prove a geometric property about circles and lines within a triangle. The task is to fill in missing parts of the solution with provided expressions.
1. "<missing 1>" refers to the point diametrically opposite to S, which is a key component in constructing the internal angle bisector.  Expression 7, which is `S' \implies AS'`, matches this.
2. "<missing 2>" refers to the angle whose bisector is of interest, which is $\angle BAC$. Thus, expression 23 matches.
3. "<missing 3>" is the intersection of BS with some line. Given the next statement involves the perpendicular from A to BC, expression 27, which is `AS'`, makes sense here as we are intersecting the line segment BS with the line from A which is perpendicular to BC and hence parallel to SS'. The line from A to BC is denoted by AH in later parts of the solution so the expression relating to that makes sense.
4. "<missing 4>" describes the line through which some point is constructed. Given the previous step, and the fact that A is on the circumcircle $\Omega$, expression 17 makes the most sense as it is related to constructing the orthocenter.
5. "<missing 5>" relates to a length that is needed to finish the proof. Expression 12, `PH = AH`, is a relevant length equality.
6. "<missing 6>" should denote the equality of angles. Expression 30 seems most likely here.
7. "<missing 7>" refers to the the incenter and should match with an expression which indicates the point F. Expression 1 seems to fit as it contains `BF'` .
8. "<missing 8>" is a triangle. Since we are talking about the incenter, then $\triangle ABF$, given in expression 21, is relevant here.
9. "<missing 9>" is describing the circumcenter, and expression 3 makes sense as it is describing the intersection of line segments.
10. "<missing 10>" should refer to the orthocenter and expression 3 makes sense here.
11. "<missing 11>" refers to the fact that lines are concyclic. Expression 2 contains points G, and also a mention of B, meaning it likely contains the concyclic points.
12. "<missing 12>" should relate to concyclic points, expression 18 makes sense.
13. "<missing 13>"  is a connection between points. Expression 13 matches as it indicates collinearity.
14. "<missing 14>" refers to a point which is symmetric. Expression 14 contains the symmetry.
15. "<missing 15>" should refer to the circumcircle. Expression 15 is the circumcircle of the triangle.
16. "<missing 16>" is a triangle for a lemma. Thus expression 21 seems to be relevant here, $\triangle ABF$.
17. "<missing 17>" needs to be a triangle. So expression 26 `H, \angle ABS = \varphi.` is a good option.
18. "<missing 18>" refers to a circle. Expression 15, `\Omega`, matches the circumcircle.
19. "<missing 19>" is a triangle, thus expression 21 is relevant.
20. "<missing 20>"  needs to be a line segment with F' as the end, thus expression 28 makes sense.
21. "<missing 21>" is a point on the circumcircle, so expression 29 `E'` seems appropriate.
22. "<missing 22>"  is an equality. Expression 22 `E'D || BC` seems to match.
23. "<missing 23>" should relate to the orthocenter of a triangle, thus expression 31 matches `HD`.
24. "<missing 24>" is a point on a circle. Expression 25 seems like a good fit `G = PS' \cap AE \implies \angle BPG = \angle BPS' = \angle BSS' = \angle BDG \implies B, L, P, D,` as it mentions multiple points.
25. "<missing 25>"  is a line segment. Given previous steps, expression 27 seems relevant `AS'`.
26. "<missing 26>" is a point on the circle, hence expression 4 makes sense.
27. "<missing 27>"  refers to a triangle. Expression 5 makes sense, `\triangle TSS'.`
28. "<missing 28>" is a line, given the context, expression 24, makes sense, `AH \perp BC \implies AH \perp E'D \implies`.
29. "<missing 29>" refers to the reim theorem being used, given the above the point E' is relevant. Expression 29 matches, `E'`.
30. "<missing 30>"  is an angle, thus 9 makes sense `\angle EBS' = \varphi, \angle LBG = \angle LDG = 90^\circ = \angle DBS' \implies \angle DBG = \varphi = \angle SBF \implies`
31. "<missing 31>" refers to a point. Given the construction so far, expression 20 is appropriate, `F' \neq D, HD = HF'.`
32. "<missing 32>" should refer to the circle of some sort, and in this case is the circle $\omega$. Expression 32 matches this, `\omega, \Omega`.

AI's Answer: Okay, I've analyzed the provided solution and the expressions. Here's my breakdown:

*   **<missing 1>:** This is part of the initial expansion and appears to correspond to  $a_{n+2}^2$. Thus, <expression 5> is the right fit.
*   **<missing 2>:** This is the next step in the expansion of $a_{n+2}^2$, which has the expanded summations using $x_{n+1}$ and $x_{n+2}$. Therefore, <expression 2> matches.
*   **<missing 3>:** The solution uses this filler later. We will try <expression 3>.
*   **<missing 4>:** The solution states the result of the application of AM-GM inequality after accounting for the fact that the $x_i$s are distinct. This corresponds to the fact that $a_{n+2} \ge a_{n} + 2+1 = a_n+3$, and <expression 4> is the closest match.
*   **<missing 5>:**  This appears to be the fully expanded version of <missing 2>. Thus, <expression 9> matches.
*   **<missing 6>:** This is the general result for $a_{2023}$ that is used to provide the final solution. Therefore, <expression 6> is the corresponding one.
*   **<missing 7>:** This appears to represent the integer value of the n-th term in the given equation.  Therefore <expression 7> is the best match.
*   **<missing 8>:** This refers to the application of the AM-GM inequality and is expressed by <expression 13>.
*   **<missing 9>:** Here the solution is talking about $a_{n+2}$ and specifically the equality part of the AM-GM. This is filled by <expression 10>.
*   **<missing 10>:** This part refers to the condition for equality in AM-GM for the variables in the equation, and it states they all have to be equal, and thus relates to the fact that the x's cannot be equal, so we use <expression 12>.
*   **<missing 11>:** This is an incorrect equality and it is not required here, so I use a filler of <expression 1>.
*   **<missing 12>:** Since there is a previous mention of there being no equal x's this should be <expression 12> as it completes the phrase.
*    **<missing 13>:** This is the inequality arising after the AM-GM application given that no two x's are equal. The best match is <expression 13>

AI's Answer: <Detailed reasoning>
The problem asks us to find real numbers α such that the sum of the absolute values of multiples of α up to n is divisible by n. The solution first shows that even integers work, and then tries to show that no other real numbers do. We are given a solution with missing parts and a list of formulas to fill in. I have analyzed each missing part and matched it with the correct formula from the list, taking into consideration the logic and context of the overall solution. The most tricky part was that the solution incorrectly used [nε] = 0 and [mε] = m-1 via induction. I have corrected that. The matching has been done by carefully observing the logic of each case and comparing it to each expression to see which expression was most appropriate.

AI's Answer: Okay, let's analyze the provided solution and match the missing tags with the given expressions step-by-step.

1. **<missing 1>**:  The solution starts by saying "It is clear that we may take <missing 1> for (a,b) = (1,1)". This refers to the gcd being a constant. The correct expression should be the definition of g. So, we are looking for a statement about the constant value of the gcd when a=1 and b=1, which is 2. So, we need a statement with a constant g. $\gcd(a,b)$ for $(a,b)=(1,1)$ is $1$ and when $n$ tends to infintiy then this should become $1+1 = 2$. Therefore, we need <expression 13> as the first one which states $\gcd(a^n + b, b^n + a) = g$

2. **<missing 2>**: The sentence continues "Supposing that <missing 2> satisfies the conditions in the problem". We are looking for something that introduces the general condition. This is the case when we're looking for a case other than a=b=1, so we are stating a generic pair (a,b), which is <expression 8> which states (a,b).

3. **<missing 3>**: "let N be a positive integer such that <missing 3> for all n ≥ N". We already know that gcd(a^n+b,b^n+a)=g for all $n\ge N$. So, we are stating the condition from the problem statement which is $\gcd(a^n + b, b^n + a) = g$. This is expression <expression 13>.

4. **<missing 4>**: The Lemma starts with "We have that <missing 4> or <missing 5>". The lemma states that g divides either a-b, or g divides $2\gcd(a,b)$. Hence, the first part is $g$ divides $a-b$. However, none of the provided expressions state this explicitly, and only $\gcd(a,b)$ is available in the options. Also, there's no direct $a-b$. However, since in the proof of this lemma we use that $g$ divides $b(a-1)$ and $a(b-1)$, we know that if $g$ does not divide $a-b$ then $g$ divides $2gcd(a,b)$. Therefore, we should be choosing $\gcd(a,b)$. However, the only relevant expression that we have is <expression 27> which states $g = \gcd(a,b)$. However, this is not the best one. The Lemma is about the divisibility of the gcd, not the gcd itself. Thus we need something from the conclusion of the lemma. The lemma is, $g \mid a-b$ or $g \mid 2gcd(a,b)$. The second part is in <expression 21>. The first part does not exist. We are looking for a $d = gcd(a,b)$. <expression 4> represents $\gcd(a,b)$, which is not exactly what we are looking for, but its the closest we have. Thus we choose 21. This is incorrect. The lemma is that either g divides a-b or g divides 2gcd(a,b). We need expression 21, where we have $g \mid 2\gcd(a,b)$. We have to choose between <expression 1> ($a-b$) or <expression 21> ($g \mid 2\gcd(a,b)$). Since we have to choose one from the options, and g divides $a-b$ is not in the options, so we pick the second part of the lemma, which is $g \mid 2gcd(a,b)$. This is <expression 21>

5. **<missing 5>**: The other part of the lemma, is g divides $2gcd(a,b)$. Therefore, since it is an "or", this should be the other possibility, which is that $d=x=y=1$. This translates to either g divides a-b or g divides $2gcd(a,b)$. So, we need an expression that provides us the $2gcd(a,b)$ option. The other part of the lemma states $d=x=y=1$ or something equivalent. <expression 5> provides this condition, so we pick this.

6.  **<missing 6>**: The proof starts "Note that both <missing 6> and <missing 7> are divisible by g". This is when n=N+1. So, we need $a^{N+1}+b$ as the first term which is given by <expression 6>.

7.  **<missing 7>**: The proof continues "Note that both <missing 6> and <missing 7> are divisible by g". The second term that is divisible by $g$ is $a^N+b$ . So, we need $a^N+b$. This is equivalent to writing the gcd condition when n=N. The expression that is the closest to $a^N+b$ is in <expression 9>, and this seems the most appropriate one, where it is stating $a + b \equiv a^N + b \equiv 0 \pmod{g}$.

8. **<missing 8>**: The next sentence says "Hence <missing 8> is divisible by g". We are looking for $a(a^N+b) - (a^{N+1}+b) = ab-b = b(a-1)$. This does not directly exist in the expressions. We then need to find $b(a-1)$. This is not explicit. The closest expression that introduces $a-1$ is <expression 14>, however it does not just have a-1. However, in the proof, the expression after that is $b(a-1)$, and the previous line states, "both are divisible by g" and then the conclusion is "<missing 8> is divisible by g".  We are stating that $a^N + b$ and $a^{N+1}+b$ are divisible by g, and thus <missing 8> must also be divisible by g.  The most likely candidate from the options is that $g$ divides $a^N + b$, therefore the most appropriate expression is 14, as it describes the steps used to derive $b(a-1)$. This is not correct. We are looking for something that is divisible by g. In the sentence, it is stated that the two values are divisible by g and thus their difference is also divisible by g. It is the difference between the two expressions. However, that is $a^N+b$ and the equivalent of $b^N+a$. Therefore, we want an expression that is of this form, and that is <expression 9> which is equivalent to $a^N+b \equiv 0 \pmod g$.

9. **<missing 9>**: "Analogously, <missing 9> is divisible by g". This would be the term coming from the other side, so it is $a(b-1)$. Therefore it is similar to the <missing 8>, but from the b side. This should be $b^N+a$ being divisible by g. We have $a + b \equiv a^N + b \equiv 0 \pmod{g}$. However, this is not about $a^N+b$, but about $b^N+a$. The analog statement would be $a+b \equiv b^N + a \equiv 0 \pmod{g}$. Therefore, we are looking for $b^N+a$, but the closest is <expression 9>.

10. **<missing 10>**: "Their difference <missing 10> is then divisible by g".  The difference should be $a(b-1) - b(a-1) = a-b$. However, it seems it is referring to $b(a-1)$ from step <missing 8> and $a(b-1)$ from step <missing 9> and their difference is $b(a-1)-a(b-1)=b(a-1)-a(b-1) = ab - b -ab+a= a-b$. Therefore we want an expression that provides us with $a-b$. There is no expression for $a-b$. We require the difference between $b(a-1)$ and $a(b-1)$, which is $a-b$. There is no $a-b$ in the given options. Since we are dealing with the previous step which was <expression 9>, the answer should be <expression 1>.

11. **<missing 11>**: So $g$ also divides <missing 11>". From the previous step, their difference was $a-b$, however that's not a tag here. So, we are looking for something that $g$ divides. The options are related to $a$ or $b$. From <missing 10> it was $a-b$ , so it should be <expression 1> but it is stating the conclusion that all powers of a are congruent modulo g. The previous step was the difference of the two, therefore we must be talking about the value that is obtained by the proof, which should be $a-b$ so its <expression 1>.

12. **<missing 12>**: "All powers of a are then congruent modulo g, so <missing 12>". Since all powers of $a$ are congruent modulo $g$, then we must have $a^n+b \equiv a+b \equiv 0 \pmod g$. Then, this implies that $a+b = 2a \equiv 0 \pmod g$, so $g$ divides 2a and 2b so $g$ divides $2\gcd(a,b)$. This means that g divides 2 times the gcd of a,b. Since $g$ divides $a-b$, it implies that $a \equiv b \pmod g$. Thus $a^N+b$ is congruent to $a+a=2a$. Thus we have $2a \equiv 0 \pmod g$. Therefore we are concluding that $g$ must divide $2\gcd(a,b)$. Since this is the conclusion of the argument so far, we require <expression 12> as the value of g.

13. **<missing 13>**: Then <missing 13> and <missing 14> are both divisible by g". This should be stating what we know from the problem statement, $\gcd(a^n+b,b^n+a)=g$, which is <expression 13>.

14. **<missing 14>**: "Then <missing 13> and <missing 14> are both divisible by g". We have that $a(a^N+b) - (a^{N+1}+b) = b(a-1)$ which means we must be looking for $b(a-1)$. The expression is $a(a^N+b) - (a^{N+1}+b) = ab-b=b(a-1)$. This is not exactly in the expressions but we should choose the one that is closest. We have <expression 14> which is equivalent to $b(a-1)$.

15. **<missing 15>**: "so <missing 15>". From the previous steps, we have that $g$ divides $b(a-1)$ and $a(b-1)$, and we have concluded that $g$ divides $2\gcd(a,b)$. Now it must be stating that g divides gcd(a,b). So, this means we are looking for <expression 15> where it is stated that $d$ divides $g$.

16. **<missing 16>**: "On the other hand, it is clear that <missing 16>". The lemma states that if $g$ divides $2\gcd(a,b)$ then we must have $K \mid \gcd(d^{n-1}x^n + y, d^{n-1}y^n + x) \leq 2$. Therefore, we are stating that $K$ divides the gcd.  This is <expression 17>, so it is this one.

17. **<missing 17>**: We have that K divides the gcd which is less than or equal to 2. This is the end of the proof of the lemma, so this should be the conclusion <expression 17> which is $K \mid \gcd(d^{n-1}x^n + y, d^{n-1}y^n + x) \leq 2$.

18. **<missing 18>**: "Let <missing 18>". Here we are defining $d$ as the gcd of $a$ and $b$, so $d = \gcd(a,b)$ which is <expression 4>.

19. **<missing 19>**: "and write <missing 19> and <missing 20>".  We are writing that $a=dx$. So we have that $a = dx$. Therefore, <expression 20> should be placed here.

20. **<missing 20>**: "and write <missing 19> and <missing 20>".  We are also writing that $b = dy$. So, we have that $b = dy$. Therefore, <expression 10> should be placed here.

21. **<missing 21>**: We have that <missing 21>". Here we are stating that $\gcd(a^n + b, b^n + a) = d \gcd(d^{n-1}x^n + y, d^{n-1}y^n + x)$. Since $g$ divides $2\gcd(a,b)$, we must have g divides $2d$. Therefore we need <expression 21>, which is $g \mid 2\gcd(a,b)$.

22. **<missing 22>**: so the Lemma tells us that <missing 22> for all n ≥ N". From our modular proof, we have shown that $K \mid d^{n-1}x^n + y$. So this is <expression 22>.

23.  **<missing 23>**: Defining <missing 23>". This is where we are defining $K = d^2xy+1$. This is <expression 3>.

24. **<missing 24>**: "By Euler's theorem, for <missing 24>". This should be stating that the modularity should be with $\phi(K)$, or some condition related to $K$. From the modular proof, we have $n \equiv -1 \pmod{\phi(K)}$. Therefore, we should have an expression related to the modularity. The closest expression we have here is <expression 19> which is $n \equiv -1 \pmod{\varphi(K)}$.

25. **<missing 25>**: we have that <missing 25>". We have $d^{n-1}y^n + x \equiv 0 \pmod K$. So we are looking for something divisible by K. This is <expression 25> which states that $K \mid d^{n-1}y^n + x$.

26. **<missing 26>**: so <missing 26>".  We are looking for $d^{n-1}x^n + y = 0 \pmod{K}$ is equivalent to $d^{-2}x^{-1}+y=0 \pmod{K}$. However, we are showing that if n = -1 mod \phi(K) then $d^{n-1}x^n + y$ is divisible by K, and analogously $d^{n-1}y^n+x$. We are looking for a value that is equivalent to 0. In this modular arithmetic derivation, we have that $d^{n-1}x^n + y \equiv d^{-2}x^{-1}(1+d^2xy)=0 \pmod{K}$. Thus, we are looking for an expression where $x^n$ is close to 0. This does not exist. We need something to show that $d^{n-1}x^n + y \equiv 0 \pmod K$ and $d^{n-1}y^n+x \equiv 0 \pmod{K}$. However, none of the expressions show this. Therefore we should look for an expression that uses this fact to continue the proof. If we were to choose, we should choose <expression 26>, which seems to be some intermediate calculation.

27. **<missing 27>**: "Analogously, we have that <missing 27>". We are looking for the same, but for y instead of x, but we want an expression that provides us with the condition that $d^{n-1}y^n+x$ is divisible by $K$. We have that $d^{n-1}y^n + x \equiv 0 \pmod K$, however we are looking for something that the value is equal to. This is very similar to <missing 26>. However, we can try the expression that we have previously used for the lemma which is <expression 27>, where $g = \gcd(a,b)$ which we have used to denote as $d$.

28. **<missing 28>**: "Taking such an n which also satisfies n >= N gives us that <missing 28>". We have that $K \mid \gcd(d^{n-1}x^n + y, d^{n-1}y^n + x)$ and from the lemma we know that the $\gcd(d^{n-1}x^n + y, d^{n-1}y^n + x) \leq 2$ so we have that the $\gcd(d^{n-1}x^n + y, d^{n-1}y^n + x) \leq 2$, which means K divides a value that is less or equal to 2. Thus we want to choose <expression 28>

29. **<missing 29>**: "This is only possible when <missing 29>".  The conclusion is $K \leq 2$, and since $K=d^2xy+1$, this is only possible when $d=x=y=1$, and thus $a=b=1$. We are looking for an expression that can state this. The only expression that does not make sense here is <expression 29>, where we have $a(b-1) + a(a-b) = a^2 - a$. This may indicate the relation between $a$ and $b$, therefore it should be the final expression to pick, which should be <expression 29>.

AI's Answer: <Detailed reasoning>
Okay, let's analyze the problem and the provided solution. The goal is to match the missing tags <missing 1> through <missing 17> with the given expressions.

The core idea is to analyze the geometric construction, focusing on the properties of the incenter, incircle, and reflected points.
1. **<missing 1>**:  The solution states that "Lines <missing 1> and <missing 2> are the reflections of AC and AB in I".  The reflection of AC is A'X. Thus, <missing 1> is A'X which is given by expression 7.
2.  **<missing 2>**:  Similarly, the reflection of AB is A'Y, which is expression 4.
3.  **<missing 3>**: The reflected lines are tangents to the incircle. So, <missing 3> is incircle which is given by expression 16, labeled as $\omega$.
4. **<missing 4>**: It is given that <missing 4> and since <missing 5> ... we find that $PB = PC = PI$ which is expression 14.
5.  **<missing 5>**:   The statement is "since <missing 5> ...  Hence <missing 7>". Looking at the following statement we know that we need the condition that $\angle BAP = \angle PAC > 30^\circ$ , which corresponds to expression 17. However, a prior step is needed, which is the assumption that $A'C'B$. Looking at the solution we can see that $A'C'B$ which is expression 5 relates to this condition.
6. **<missing 6>**: It says "...<missing 6> is greater than circumradius. Hence <missing 7> ... ". The condition that $PI > \frac{1}{2}AP > AI$ which corresponds to expression 12 and the following line refers to <missing 7>.
7. **<missing 7>**: It concludes that "A' lies in the interior of segment AP" after the statement with <missing 6>. The conclusion is based on the fact that the line $A'X$ is related to <missing 1> which we said is A'X i.e. expression 7.
8.  **<missing 8>**: The solution then states "We have <missing 8> in the circumcircle...". This relates to the condition that $PB = PC$ which corresponds to expression 8.
9.  **<missing 9>**: Following this we have the statement "and <missing 9> because <missing 10>". It is given that $\angle APB = \angle ACB$ because they both subtend the same arc, which is given by expression 9.
10. **<missing 10>**: It refers to the reason why the previous statement is true and it's because $A'X \parallel AC$, which is expression 10.
11. **<missing 11>**: Given the cyclicity of $BPA'X$ "Hence, <missing 11>". Here we can infer that $\angle APX = \angle A'BC$, which corresponds to expression 11.
12. **<missing 12>**: The solution then mentions "Now we are ready to transform <missing 12>". Based on the problem statement we know that we need to prove that $\angle KIL + \angle YPX = 180^\circ$, so this corresponds to expression 2.
13.  **<missing 13>**: The statement is "... to the sum of angles in triangle <missing 13>". The statement refers to triangle $CA'B$ which is given by expression 5.
14. **<missing 14>**: Next we have "By a homothety of factor 2 at A we have <missing 14>". The homothety transforms  $\angle KIL$ to  $\angle CA'B$, this means that expression 15 is the right match.
15. **<missing 15>**: Now the statement "In circles $BPA'X$ and $CYA'P$ we have <missing 15> and <missing 16>". For <missing 15>, we have $\angle KIL = \angle CA'B$, which is expression 15.
16. **<missing 16>**: Similarly for <missing 16> we are referring to the incircle $\omega$ which is given by expression 16.
17. **<missing 17>**: The last part, is "therefore <missing 17>". Here the conclusion is $\angle KIL + \angle YPX = 180^\circ$, and its full justification which is given by expression 6.

AI's Answer: Okay, let's analyze the provided solution step-by-step to match the missing tags with the given expressions.

1.  **<missing 1>**: This is where we list the factors of 3!. 3! = 6. The provided expression 4 is the expression for 4! and expression 1 is actually 4!. This is incorrect. We need the value of 3!, and that is expression 4.
2.  **<missing 2>**: This is where we list the factors of 4!. 4! = 24.  The expression 1 is correct for 4!.
3.  **<missing 3>**: The solution states that n=5 does not work and later states that the consecutive factors are 6, 8, and 24. This is incorrect, since there are factors between 8 and 24. Also n=5 does not work as shown in my analysis above.  This should be n=5 as in expression 8.
4.  **<missing 4>**: The consecutive terms listed are 6, 8 and 24, this is not correct, but the 6, 8 part is a factor. Also 16 is in fact a factor, but not a consecutive factor. This is referencing 6 and 8 which are not consecutive in 5! (6,8,10 is a more accurate sequence to examine). The idea is to identify a sequence such as (1,2), (2,3), etc.  The solution seems to want factors 6 and then 8. This means that the correct answer should be referencing consecutive factors of 5! that violate the increasing difference rule. I will guess at the 6 being referenced and try to pick the expression most closely tied to n=5. The only expression related to 5 is actually expression 19 which references 6!. This is not correct, the factors should be 4,5,6 so the missing part should be 6, which is a factor, it is also the smaller of the factors being considered. Since 6 is the lower number being examined. The text uses the number 6 in it and thus it is a good guess. So we pick the expression related to 5! which has some reference to the number 6, which is expression 19 (even though this is not the factor).
5.  **<missing 5>**: This is referencing the factors of n!, where n=5. Thus the answer should be referencing 5!, expression 5.
6.  **<missing 6>**: The text says that the number 6 does not work because 8 and 9 appear as consecutive factors. This is incorrect, the factors of 6! are shown above, and the consecutive factors are not 8 and 9. Instead we want an expression related to n=6. Thus the expression should be 19 referencing that n=6 does not work.
7.  **<missing 7>**:  This is referencing the term '8' from 6! The correct term should be 9. This would mean the correct answer is a number related to 9. Expression 9 has to do with primes so it does not fit.  I believe the missing number should be the number 9 as a consecutive factor in 6!, which was previously called as 8 in the text.
8.  **<missing 8>**:  The missing expression should be related to n=6 and be referencing 6!. Therefore the most fitting expression is 16.
9.  **<missing 9>**: This is a prime number p such that p > n. The relevant expression for this is expression 11, noting that p > n
10. **<missing 10>**: This references an integer k, the context requires that k and k+1 are factors. The missing numbers appear as k and k+1 where they are factors. This should be any pair of consecutive numbers. Expression 12 has 15, 20 which are not consecutive. The only number that fits this description is 12.
11. **<missing 11>**: This term has k and k+1. The expression is thus an expression that gives k+1 in terms of k. This is expression 2.
12. **<missing 12>**: For odd n >= 7, this expression references 5! as a factor. Therefore the correct expression is 15.
13. **<missing 13>**: This refers to (n-2)(n). The correct expression is 10.
14. **<missing 14>**: This uses the inequality 2n < n^2 - 4n + 3. The correct expression should be the incorrect condition $2n < n^2 - 4n + 3$. However the text states that is incorrect and should be referencing a prime between the two consecutive factors. Expression 3 has the wrong expression. Since the correct answer should be a numerical condition, that gives the smallest difference in the sequence, the answer should be expression 3.
15. **<missing 15>**: This also states the inequality is incorrect. Also we want the expression to be referring to the prime between the numbers, therefore this should be referencing that prime with n. The expression most closely related is 18, which references a prime.
16. **<missing 16>**: This references n >= 8 and even. This statement incorrectly states that 6 and 8 are factors. The correct answer should have to do with n>=8 and an even number. Therefore it should be 17.

AI's Answer: <Detailed reasoning>
Okay, let's analyze the problem and the provided solution step-by-step to identify the correct expression numbers for each missing tag.

1. **<missing 1>**: The text mentions "the point diametrically opposite to a point S", and the solution goes on to discuss the internal angle bisector. The diametrically opposite point is related to the line perpendicular to BC.  The expression that matches this is <expression 10> which states "S' \implies AS'". So, <missing 1> is 10.
2.  **<missing 2>**: The sentence is "the internal angle bisector of <missing 2>".  Since the final goal of the problem is to prove a property about the internal angle bisector of $\angle BAC$,  <missing 2> is 3.
3.  **<missing 3>**: This appears within the context of the cross point of BS and another line. Looking ahead, the solution defines F as the intersection of SS' and AC, where SS' is related to the perpendicular from S to BC.  Therefore, <missing 3> is 7 ("AH").
4.  **<missing 4>**: The line must intersect BS at F which is not B, so it is "F \neq B". Therefore, <missing 4> is 4.
5.  **<missing 5>**: This is part of the argument related to perpendicularity. The expression relating $AH \perp BC$ to the implications of this perpendicularity is <expression 5>, so <missing 5> is 5.
6.  **<missing 6>**: The missing expression defines the point F as the intersection of SS' and AC. Looking at our expressions, <expression 16> is "F = SS' \cap AC ...", which fits. Therefore <missing 6> is 16.
7. **<missing 7>**: This follows from the definition of F and deduces angles using inscribed angles.  The most relevant expression is 29, which deduces angles using $\overset{\Large\frown}{BS}$. Thus, <missing 7> is 29.
8.  **<missing 8>**: This refers to the circumcircle of ABC, which is denoted by $\Omega$. Thus, <missing 8> is 8.
9. **<missing 9>**: The missing part is the key condition for completing the proof, and it is about $HD = HF'$. This is provided by <expression 9>, "F' \neq D, HD = HF'". So <missing 9> is 9.
10. **<missing 10>**: The point S' is the foot of perpendicular from S to BC. The expression relating to this is <expression 10>, thus, <missing 10> is 10.
11. **<missing 11>**: The text discusses the cyclic nature of the points B, L, P, D, and G. The expression that describes these cyclic points is <expression 11> "B, L, P, D, G". Therefore, <missing 11> is 11.
12. **<missing 12>**: This references parallel lines in the diagram, specifically E'D and BC. The only expression stating that is <expression 12>, which states "E'D || BC". So, <missing 12> is 12.
13. **<missing 13>**: The equality refers to lengths. Expression 13, "HF = HD.", fits in this context. So, <missing 13> is 13.
14. **<missing 14>**: The expression refers to which segment is symmetric to AF. This is HD, which matches with <expression 14> "HD". Therefore, <missing 14> is 14.
15. **<missing 15>**: This is the angle relation which follows from the symmetric relation. The only expression that defines the angle relations is <expression 15>. So <missing 15> is 15.
16. **<missing 16>**: Lemma 1 starts with "Let acute triangle <missing 16> be given". So <missing 16> is <expression 24>, "\triangle ABC, AB > AC".
17. **<missing 17>**: This states $H$ is the orthocenter of some triangle. Since Lemma 1 is about the triangle $ABC$, <missing 17> is expression 24.
18. **<missing 18>**: The circle is the circumcircle of the triangle, $\Omega$. The expression which defines this as $AS'$ is <expression 8>. So <missing 18> is 8.
19. **<missing 19>**: The circle with diameter AS' is the circumcircle of TSS'. Thus <missing 19> is expression 19.
20. **<missing 20>**: The point $E$ is the symmetric point to $D$ with respect to some line. That line is $AH$. Therefore <missing 20> is expression 20.
21. **<missing 21>**: The point where BE meets the circle is E'. Therefore <missing 21> is <expression 21> "E'".
22. **<missing 22>**: This completes the lemma and states that $E=E'$. This can be matched with <expression 22>, so <missing 22> is 22.
23. **<missing 23>**: This mentions the radius of $\omega$ and relates it to equal lengths. The equality we need here is HF=HD, which is <expression 13>, so <missing 23> is 13.
24. **<missing 24>**: This is the intersection of $\omega$ with $\Omega$, which is $E'$. Thus <missing 24> is expression 21.
25. **<missing 25>**:  $\omega$ meets $BE'$ again at $F'$, which is <expression 25>, so <missing 25> is 25.
26. **<missing 26>**: This references the triangle that defines the circle where we use Reim's theorem. This is triangle $BCD$, so <missing 26> is 26.
27. **<missing 27>**: The circle we use Reim's theorem on is $\omega$. Therefore <missing 27> is <expression 31>, which is 31.
28. **<missing 28>**: This refers to lines to which we apply reim's theorem and it is TF. Therefore <missing 28> is <expression 28>, 28.
29. **<missing 29>**: This is the angle relation from Reim's Theorem, and is <expression 29>, 29.
30. **<missing 30>**: The following statement is another angle relationship which is <expression 30>. Thus <missing 30> is 30.
31. **<missing 31>**: This refers to the circle intersections, which is between $\omega$ and $\Omega$, <expression 31>, so <missing 31> is 31.
32. **<missing 32>**: The point is symmetric to D with respect to some line. That is AH. Therefore <missing 32> is <expression 7>, 7.

AI's Answer: Okay, let's analyze the provided solution and match the missing tags with the given expressions.

1. **<missing 1>**: The first missing part is in the context of the trivial case where (a,b) = (1,1).  The solution states it's clear that we may take *something* for this case. The natural choice is the gcd, so we are looking for a statement related to gcd(1,1). Expression 28 is likely, but let us proceed. So, <missing 1> is likely expression 28
2. **<missing 2>**: This missing part is in the context of assuming that *something* satisfies the condition of the problem.  It is likely something related to a and b satisfying given conditions. Expression 20 could work but it is likely to be that (a,b) are different to (1,1). Expression 7 is a square and doesn't make any sense. Expression 20 looks like a better fit. So <missing 2> is probably expression 20.
3. **<missing 3>**: This part is about the gcd being equal to g for all n greater or equal to N, expression 28 is a good fit here
4. **<missing 4> and <missing 5>**: These are part of a lemma. It seems that a(b-1) shows up. So <missing 4> is likely 4, and we see that <missing 5> should be related to a = dx based on later parts of the text. So 5.
5. **<missing 6>**: <missing 6> and <missing 7> are terms that are divisible by g. We have a^n+b and b^n+a, expression 27 seems related to one of them. Expression 27 is $a^N + b$ . There does not seem to be a matching expression for b^n + a but based on the text they are similar and we choose expression 27 as the best fit and later we may revise it. So lets assume it is 27
6.  **<missing 7>**: As discussed, we need an expression that is similar to $a^N+b$. So this is probably $b^n+a$. However none are matching exactly, and we cannot use 27 again, so this is the square symbol, 7, it does not really mean anything. So we are going with 7.
7. **<missing 8>**:  This is about what divides g. The solution text says "Hence ... is divisible by g". The text after mentions that gcd(a,b) is a factor, and a 2 coefficient is there. So expression 8 is the best fit here, as it states that g divides 2*gcd(a,b).
8. **<missing 9>**: This is again something that is divisible by g, similar to the previous step. The text uses the word "Analogously", so this must be something similar to  `a(a^N + b) - (a^{N+1} + b)`, which implies we must be doing $b(b^N + a) - (b^{N+1} + a)$. Which means that <missing 9> is related to expression 21, but there is no expression for that. So we will have to choose something based on the context. There is an expression with gcd in it. So, we go for 9.
9.  **<missing 10>**: This is a difference of the expressions that are divided by g. The solution says their difference "<missing 10>" is divisible by g. The expression 19 "a-b" appears earlier, but it might mean we are looking for another expression related to difference of terms, in this case an expression such as a^2 - a, so the best fit is  29.
10. **<missing 11>**: This is about what g divides, the context says "all powers of a" are congruent modulo g. We see $a+b \equiv a^N+b \equiv 0 \pmod{g}$ so we choose expression 11 here.
11. **<missing 12>**: This is related to  $a^{N+1} + b$. The only expression here is 12 itself.
12. **<missing 13>**: g is equal to something. It should be something about the gcd. Based on the Lemma, it should be 2 times the gcd so 13.
13.  **<missing 14>**: We have a list of variables all equal to 1. expression 14.
14. **<missing 15>**: Based on the previous steps, we are dealing with d, x, and y. The text after that uses the term 'on the other hand'. It suggests something is less than or equal to 2. So, we look for expression containing gcd and less than 2, i.e., 15
15. **<missing 16>**: Here, we are introducing a variable d and express a and b in terms of it. Expression 16 is the correct match as it relates b to d and y
16. **<missing 17>**: We have the 'square' expression. Nothing fits except the square, expression 7
17. **<missing 18>**: Defining K. We are given an expression for K using d, x and y. Expression 1 is the right fit.
18. **<missing 19>**:  We have a and b. We have already defined d = gcd(a,b) and a = dx, b= dy. The missing tag is "and write <missing 19> and <missing 20>". <missing 19> is thus a - b, which is expression 19.
19. **<missing 20>**: <missing 20> must be the pair (a,b), which is expression 20
20.  **<missing 21>**: We are dealing with d, x, y and their powers. Looking at the Lemma and the expression K = d^2xy+1, then expression 9 makes sense.
21. **<missing 22>**: In the text it says 'the Lemma tells us that' so we need an expression that is related to K. Expression 18 looks like a good candidate, but it is for d^{n-1}x^n+y. But 22 is a better fit since 22 has $d^{n-1}y^n+x$
22. **<missing 23>**: This is the definition of d as gcd(a,b), so 23
23. **<missing 24>**: This is when g=2 is considered, expression 24
24.  **<missing 25>**: This is when g = gcd(a,b). Expression 25 is the right choice
25.  **<missing 26>**: This is about the powers in Euler's theorem, so 26
26.  **<missing 27>**: We have that something equals something based on Euler's theorem. Following the same logic with powers, we take 27.
27.  **<missing 28>**: We need the expression for the original problem statement, gcd(a^n+b, b^n+a)=g. Expression 28 matches.
28. **<missing 29>**: "This is only possible when" , then the expression should be a condition, so 29.

AI's Answer: <Detailed reasoning>
Okay, I will now go through the solution and match the missing tags with the provided expressions.
- <missing 1>: The first missing tag refers to the beginning of the proof where a generic integer is being referred to, which would best be replaced by "Let $a_n$". Expression 13 says "$a_n$".
- <missing 2>: The second missing tag refers to the maximum number of times an integer appears, which we've determined as $k$, which is found in expression 21 where $x \le k$. The meaning is slightly different, but contextually this makes sense since the previous sentence states "every integer $x \geq M$ appears at most <missing 2> times.". So we will pick expression 21.
- <missing 3>: The third missing tag references the appearance of an integer for the k+1th time, which matches expression 32 with "k+1".
- <missing 4>: The fourth missing tag refers to integers greater than $N$ that appear at least $k$ times. We found above that that is "g > max(k, N)", so expression 29 is correct.
- <missing 5>: The fifth missing tag is referring to the number "g" which does not appear infinitely often, so from previous reasoning it must be a big number with $x > l$, so expression 46 should work.
- <missing 6>: The sixth missing tag refers to the largest number that appears more than $k$ times, which we have called $l$, and which was set as $l \ge k$ or $x > k$. So the right expression is 46, with $l \ge x > k$.
- <missing 7>: The seventh missing tag introduces the definition of a "big" number, which is when x > l, so we pick expression 27 which says $x > l$.
- <missing 8>: The eighth missing tag is referring to a "medium" number, which we have defined as $k < x \le l$, so we pick expression 31 where $l \ge x > k$.
- <missing 9>: The ninth missing tag is referring to a "small" number, which we have defined as $x \le k$, so we pick expression 21, where $x \le k$.
- <missing 10>: The tenth missing tag refers to when we choose a large enough $N'$. Expression 2 is the correct choice "N'".
- <missing 11>: The eleventh missing tag refers to the previous point when every medium number has made all appearances and every small number has made more than max(k, N) appearances, so this refers to the first $N'$ numbers. $a_1, \ldots, a_{N'}$. We pick expression 37 where $N' > N$ (This is not precise).
- <missing 12>: The twelfth missing tag refers to the definition of $N'$, so it must mean $g > max(k, N)$. So, the correct expression is 29 where $g > \max(k, N)$.
- <missing 13>: The 13th missing tag refers to "g" appearing after $a_{N'}$, so it should be followed by some small number $h$ which is the count of the small numbers appearing at least g times. The small number that appears before is $a_{n-1}$, so this is $g > max(k, N)$, then, $a_n$ is a small number, so it has appeared > $\max(k,N)$ times, so this is 8, where $g > N$.
- <missing 14>: The fourteenth missing tag is when every small number appears after a big number, so the small number $h$ has a minimum appearance count and hence we need an expression stating that $g > N$. Expression 8, $g > N$.
- <missing 15>: The fifteenth missing tag is stating that every gth appearance of a small number must occur after $a_N$, which is from definition. This refers to the g-th appearence, so expression 16 should be the right pick.
- <missing 16>: The sixteenth missing tag is the "g" th appearance of g, we have expression 16, so that is the correct answer $g^{th}$
- <missing 17>: The seventeenth missing tag introduces $a_i$ subsequence, and we are given an index in the form of $i > n$. The correct expression for that is expression 17.
- <missing 18>: The eighteenth missing tag refers to the subsequence, so it needs to define the index, so the missing expression is $a_n$. So 13 is $a_n$ which is not right. We need 18, which says $a_{n-1}$ to match.
- <missing 19>: The nineteenth missing tag is condition (a) of lemma 2 which states "$i$ and $j$ are greater than $N'$, and this missing tag must be related to the fact that $a_j > a_i$. The expression 39 states $a_{j-1} > a_{i-1}$, which is related.
- <missing 20>: The twentieth missing tag is condition (b) of lemma 2 which states "$a_{i-1}$ is small". We've previously defined a small number, however it is best to pick an expression which most closely describes what we require. The closest is expression 20 where it defines numbers "1, 2, ..., k-1".
- <missing 21>: The twenty first missing tag refers to the fact that $a_{j-1}$ is greater than $a_{i-1}$. The most related expression is 39, which is $a_{j-1} > a_{i-1}$.
- <missing 22>: The twenty second missing tag refers to the set of small numbers in Lemma 2. The correct expression is 5, $a_i = |\mathcal{I}|$.
- <missing 23>: The twenty third missing tag refers to a set called $\mathcal{J}$, so we want the defining equation. The correct expression is 40, $a_j = |\mathcal{J}|$.
- <missing 24>: The twenty fourth missing tag uses the lemma 1 property, we should pick expression 5 or 40, but we pick expression 40.
- <missing 25>: The twenty fifth missing tag references the set of values between two indices $i$ and $j$. This refers to a collection of indices in the form of a subset, so expression 25 is correct since it says $a_{[i,j]}$.
- <missing 26>: The twenty sixth missing tag is a bound on the number of small numbers, but not the right choice. The numbers appear at least $a_{i-1}$ times. We should pick the total number of small numbers $k$. The closest expression is 26, which states $2k$, which is wrong, we need the bound on $k$, which is $k$ itself. So we pick 33, which uses the variable $a_i$.
- <missing 27>: The twenty seventh missing tag makes a statement about $a_{j-2}$, that if it doesn't belong to $\mathcal{I}$, then it has appeared at most $a_{i-1}$ times, and hence it must belong to $\mathcal{J} \backslash \mathcal{I}$, so we pick expression 12, which says that $a_{j-2} \in \mathcal{J} \backslash \mathcal{I}$.
- <missing 28>: The twenty eighth missing tag has a condition implying $a_{j-2}$ is in $\mathcal{J}$, which is incorrect. The sentence is "Combining with <missing 28>". So the combined statement is $a_{j-2}$ is not in $\mathcal{I}$ and $a_{j-2}$ is in $\mathcal{J} \backslash \mathcal{I}$. Expression 23 matches this exactly "$a_{j-2} \in \mathcal{J}$"
- <missing 29>: The twenty ninth missing tag says that $a_{j-1} > a_{i-1}$, which is 39, but we need an inequality and a conclusion, so expression 9 is better.
- <missing 30>: The thirtieth missing tag says that $a_{j-1} > a_{i-1}$, and since we said earlier that $a_j = |\mathcal{J}|$, we have $|\mathcal{J}| > |\mathcal{I}|$, so expression 40 looks to be the best choice.
- <missing 31>: The thirty-first missing tag states that a contradiction has been reached and hence $a_{j-2}$ is in $\mathcal{I}$, so expression 10, $a_{i-2} \in \mathcal{I}$, which is not quite right, but expression 1, $a_{j-2} \in \mathcal{I}$ is the correct expression.
- <missing 32>: The thirty second missing tag implies that $a_{i-2}$ must belong to $\mathcal{J}$. The closest expression is 35.
- <missing 33>: The thirty third missing tag says that any small number has appeared $a_{j-1}$ times in $a_{[1,j-1]}$ and has also appeared more than $a_{i-1}$ times in $a_{[1, i-1]}$. We should pick expression 33, which states that $a_i$.
- <missing 34>: The thirty fourth missing tag should correspond to the fact that there are $\mathcal{J}$ numbers. The closest expression is 7, saying that $\mathcal{I} = \mathcal{J}$. However the relation here is that $\mathcal{J} \subset \mathcal{I}$. The expression we pick is 38.
- <missing 35>: The thirty fifth missing tag says that we pick a different number. The closest match is 10 where it states $a_{i-2} \in \mathcal{I}$. We require $a_{i-2} \in \mathcal{J}$, so expression 35 states $a_{i-2} \in \mathcal{J}$.
- <missing 36>: The thirty sixth missing tag says that we need to deduce $a_i$ and $a_j$, which implies we should use expression 5 or 40, but we pick 36 to state that we set $M$ to be greater than the maximum of the first N.
- <missing 37>: The thirty seventh missing tag refers to additional times in $a_{[i, j-1]}$. This should be $a_{i-1}$, but we don't have this exact statement. Closest is expression 37, where it is related to N' and N. This is incorrect, the correct answer is the fact that all the small numbers are bounded by $k$, so we pick expression 21.
- <missing 38>: The thirty eighth missing tag refers to a generic small number, which is referred to as $a_n$, so we pick expression 13, which is not quite correct, we should pick expression 33.
- <missing 39>: The thirty ninth missing tag states $i < j$, so pick 17 where $i > n$.
- <missing 40>: The fortieth missing tag relates to where $a_i$ is a small number, and we have a missing relation. The best fit is 41, $a_1, \ldots, a_{N'}$.
- <missing 41>: The forty first missing tag says that $p_n$ is related to $a_n$. So, we choose 28 which is a related index.
- <missing 42>: The forty second missing tag states $a_{n+p_n} = a_i$ is first to occur after $a_n$, so it means that $i = n$, which is a condition we check for. So we pick 42, $i = n$.
- <missing 43>: The forty third missing tag refers to Lemma 2, so we need to refer back to Lemma 2 conditions. We will pick the fact that we are looking at index $i$, and thus should pick the i-th expression, so expression 16 is good.
- <missing 44>: The forty fourth missing tag says that we want the smallest such p_n where $a_i$ is small. So this means we are looking at a collection of indices between $n$ and $n+p_n$, so the expression 44 is correct.
- <missing 45>: The forty fifth missing tag is an incorrect conclusion, as the correct one is $p_n$ is bounded by $k$. Thus we need something that implies this, and 14 says that $p_n > p_{n-2}$ which is not correct. The best fit is 45, stating $a_{[1,i-1]} \subset a_{[1,j-1]}$.
- <missing 46>: The forty sixth missing tag says something about a relation of $a_i$ and $a_j$. We choose the previous expression 1, with $a_{j-2} \in \mathcal{I}$ which is wrong. The correct one is the previous expression 10, where it states $a_{i-2} \in \mathcal{I}$. We pick expression 4.
- <missing 47>: The forty seventh missing tag says that $p_n$ is a non decreasing sequence bounded by the number of small numbers, so we need a bound. Since small numbers are $k$, we need some kind of bound with $k$. The closest fit is 26, where it says $2k$, but the correct answer is $k$ so we should instead choose 47 which states $a_{j-1} - a_{i-1} = 1$. We want a bound, but we have 26 which states 2k, and we pick this instead.

AI's Answer: Okay, let's analyze the provided solution and match the missing tags with the given expressions.

1. **`<missing 1>`**:  The sentence reads "Lines <missing 1> and <missing 2> are the reflections of $AC$ and $AB$ in $I$".  Since $A'$ is the reflection of $A$ in $I$, the reflection of the line $AC$ in $I$ should be the line passing through $A'$. Given $X$ is on the reflection line, this should be $A'X$ because reflections in I are parallel to original lines. So, the missing part is related to line segment $A'X$. Expression 12, which states $A'X \parallel AC$, seems the closest fit since it represents the geometric properties.
2.  **`<missing 2>`**: Similarly, by the same logic,  <missing 2> should be $A'Y$, the reflection of the line AB. Expression 10 represents the property of a related line $A'X$. However, expression 11, which is $A'Y$, is likely what is needed here
3.  **`<missing 3>`**: The sentence is "...tangents to <missing 3> from $X$ and $Y$". Since $X$ and $Y$ are points on the tangents to the incircle, the missing part is the incircle itself. Expression 3 is simply $\omega$, which represents the incircle.
4.  **`<missing 4>`**: The sentence is "...As is well-known, <missing 4>".  This is likely referring to some relation between the lengths of $PI$, $AP$ and $AI$. We know that the reflection $A'$ is between $A$ and $P$ and that $I$ is the center of the incircle. Also, $PI > AI$, making $A'$ is closer to $I$ than to $P$. Expression 4 ($PI > \frac{1}{2}AP > AI$) seems to be the relevant inequality based on the diagram properties.
5.  **`<missing 5>`**: This missing part refers to some angle property or property that is well known in triangle geometry. It looks like it is something to do with angle and is related to the previous statement. Expression 1 gives us a relationship between the two angles which seems not relevant in this position, expression 5 gives $A'C'B$ which might have something to do with angle but we are not given $C'$. So, it can only be used if $C'=C$. This might not be true. Expression 7 is an angle inequality but it doesn't make sense here. Expression 1 is the most likely one, since it says $\angle ACB = \angle A'XC$ which is true.  We will try expression 1 instead.
6. **`<missing 6>`**:  The text continues "..., and since <missing 5>, <missing 6> is greater than the circumradius." It should refer to a geometric property connecting the various points of the triangle. Since it says "...is greater than the circumradius", we should look for something to do with circumradius. <expression 6> "$\angle KIL = \angle CA'B$" seems to connect the points of the problem, so it seems to be the answer.
7.  **`<missing 7>`**: The sentence reads, "Hence <missing 7> ; we conclude that $A'$ lies in the interior of segment $AP$". This is an angle condition to confirm that $A'$ lies inside segment $AP$. Expression 7 ($\angle BAP = \angle PAC > 30^\circ$) confirms this, due to the given condition $AB<AC<BC$.
8.  **`<missing 8>`**: The sentence starts a new line and states "We have <missing 8> in the circumcircle". This should be something involving angles in the circumcircle. Expression 8, $\angle APB = \angle ACB$, is an inscribed angle property that matches the context.
9.  **`<missing 9>`**: The sentence reads "..., and <missing 9> because <missing 10>".  Since we are establishing $\angle KIL + \angle YPX = 180^\circ$ which is what the full proof wants to achieve. This expression should be that equation, which is given by Expression 9, i.e.,  $\angle KIL + \angle YPX = \angle CA'B + (\angle YPA + \angle APX) = \angle CA'B + \angle BCA' + \angle A'BC = 180^\circ$.
10. **`<missing 10>`**: The sentence reads "... and <missing 9> because <missing 10>". This should be the condition for the cyclic quadrilateral. The expressions with $A'X$ and $A'Y$ are good candidates for the missing link. Since we are talking about $\angle APX = \angle A'BX$ (which will come later),  Expression 10 being $A'X$ which forms $A'XC$ as explained in 5 makes this a valid possibility.
11.  **`<missing 11>`**: The next sentence "Hence, <missing 11>, and so quadrilateral $BPA'X$ is cyclic. Similarly, it follows that $CYA'P$ is cyclic". The previous was about $BPA'X$, now it should be about $CYA'P$. This should be related to $A'Y$. Expression 11 is $A'Y$.
12.  **`<missing 12>`**: The sentence reads "Now we are ready to transform <missing 12> to the sum of angles in triangle <missing 13>".  Since we have to use <missing 13> to express <missing 12>, this should refer to $\angle KIL + \angle YPX$. So, we need an expression for the sum of two angles. Expression 14 is exactly that.
13. **`<missing 13>`**: The sentence is "...sum of angles in triangle <missing 13>". Looking back, we are trying to transform $\angle KIL + \angle YPX$ into the angles of $\triangle A'BC$. Therefore, the angle sum of triangle $\triangle A'BC$ matches this. However, the correct expression to complete the sentence should be expression 13.
14. **`<missing 14>`**: The sentence is "By a homothety of factor 2 at $A$ we have <missing 14>". This should refer to the fact that we are trying to relate K and L to C and B respectively. The expression of interest is that $\angle KIL + \angle YPX$ (Expression 14).
15. **`<missing 15>`**: The sentence starts with "In circles $BPA'X$ and $CYA'P$ we have <missing 15>". Since the circles have been previously identified, it should be something to do with cyclic quadrilateral properties. Expression 15 gives  $\angle APB = \angle A'XC$, which is true.
16. **`<missing 16>`**: The sentence reads "..., therefore <missing 17>". So we should put the relation here. The only expressions that are relevant here are 16 and 17, since the angles have already been fully covered. The problem states that the $AB < AC < BC$, so, $PB=PC$ from 17 can not be used. So, expression 16 seems wrong. Instead, the equality is given by 17, which is $PB = PC$ and not $PB = PC = PI$ which is Expression 16.
17. **`<missing 17>`**:  Since 16 can not be the correct answer. Therefore 17 is the correct answer here.

AI's Answer: <Detailed reasoning>
The solution starts by stating that the smallest value of c is 2, meaning there can be at most two different values of $f(r) + f(-r)$. Then an example function is provided $f(x) = \lfloor x \rfloor - \{x\}$ which demonstrates two different values. The solution then moves onto showing why there can't be more than two values. The missing tags are related to the various steps of the proof.
<missing 1>: The smallest value is `c = 2` which is expression 53.
<missing 2>: The function used for the example is `f(x) = \lfloor x \rfloor - {x}` which is expression 60.
<missing 3>: The floor of x is defined by the latex code `\lfloor x \rfloor` which is expression 61.
<missing 4>: The fractional part of x is defined as `\{x} = x - \lfloor x \rfloor` which is expression 14.
<missing 5>: The property to be satisfied is `P(x,y)`, corresponding to `f(x + f(y)) = f(x) + y` or `f(f(x) + y) = x + f(y)`, hence expression 10.
<missing 6>: It states `Given x,y \in \mathbb{Q}` which is expression 13.
<missing 7>: The solution tries to evaluate `f(x) + y = \lfloor x \rfloor - {x} + \lfloor y \rfloor + {y} = (\lfloor x \rfloor + \lfloor y \rfloor) + ({y} - {x})` which is expression 48.
<missing 8>: The case where `f(x) + y = x+f(y)` which corresponds to expression 54
<missing 9>: If the fractional part of x is less than y `\{x} < \{y\}` which corresponds to expression 2.
<missing 10>: The fractional part of `f(x) + y` which corresponds to $f(x+f(y))$, so `P(x,y)` is expression 10
<missing 11>: The fractional part of $f(x)+y$ is `{y} - {x}` which is expression 33.
<missing 12>: The floor part of `f(x) + y` which is `\lfloor x \rfloor + \lfloor y \rfloor` which is expression 29
<missing 13>: `f(x + f(y)) = f(x) + y = (\lfloor x \rfloor + \lfloor y \rfloor) + ({y} - {x})` corresponds to `f(x) + y = \lfloor x \rfloor - {x} + \lfloor y \rfloor + {y} = (\lfloor x \rfloor + \lfloor y \rfloor) + ({y} - {x})` so it must be a case where `f(x + f(y)) = f(x) + y`, so it is expression 7.
<missing 14>: if `\{x\} > \{y\}` corresponds to expression 3
<missing 15>:  `f(f(x) + y) = x + f(y) = (\lfloor x \rfloor + \lfloor y \rfloor) + ({x} - {y})`. In this case, the correct choice would be 16.
<missing 16>: The solution claims that `f(f(x) + y) = x + f(y)` or `f(x+f(y))=f(x)+y`. The notation `f(x) + y \to x + f(y)` should correspond to `f(f(x) + y) = x + f(y)`, which is case 16.
<missing 17>: Here `g(y) = v` where v is another value, which corresponds to expression 17.
<missing 18>: When x is an integer, f(x)=x and f(-x)=-x, so `g(x)=f(x)+f(-x)=x-x=0`. That is `g(x) = 0` which is expression 42.
<missing 19>: When x is not an integer, `g(x) = -2`. Thus `g(x) = -2` which corresponds to expression 9.
<missing 20>: `x = f(-f(-x))` which is expression 20
<missing 21>: This refers to one of the cases of `P(x,y)`, where `P(x',y)` which is expression 21.
<missing 22>: It states that either `f(x + f(y)) = f(x) + y` or `f(f(x) + y) = x + f(y)`. By setting $y = -f(x)$, we have $f(x + f(-f(x))) = 0$ or $f(f(x) - f(x)) = x + f(-f(x))$ which are equivalent to each other. Also $x+f(-f(x))=0$. We must select `0 \sim x + f(-f(x))` which corresponds to 38
<missing 23>: `f(-f(-x)) = x.` which is expression 23.
<missing 24>: injectivity is proven using P(x,y), which is `P(x_1,x_2)` corresponding to expression 19.
<missing 25>: `f(x_1)+x_2 = f(x_2)+x_2`, which is expression 15.
<missing 26>: The solution supposes that x1 goes to x2. Then it states `x + f(x) \sim x + f(x)` which corresponds to `f(x_1) + x_2 \sim f(x_2) + x_1`, or 22.
<missing 27>: From  `f(x_1) = f(x_2)`, then `f(f(x_1)) = f(f(x_2))`. Because of $f(-f(x)) = -x$, $f(x_1) + x_2 = f(x_2) + x_1`, so the two sides are equal, and `f(x_1) + x_2 = f(x_2) + x_1`. Therefore, using the fact $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$, then $f(x_1) + x_2 = f(x_1) + x_1$, thus $x_2 = x_1$. From $f(f(x_1) + x_2) = x_1 + f(x_2)$, where $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$. So the mapping is`f(x_1) + x_2 \to f(x_2) + x_1` which is expression 31.
<missing 28>: This is because `f(x_1)+x_2 = f(x_2)+x_1`, thus x1=x2, so that gives `f(x_1) + x_2 = f(x_2) + x_2 = f(x_1) + x_1` or expression 58. The correct option is `x' \to x \to x' + u`, which corresponds to 28.
<missing 29>: Putting `x = 0` in `x = f(-f(-x))` gives `0 = f(-f(0))`, and then using the mapping we get `0 = f(0)`, which is expression 32.
<missing 30>: Substituting this into `f(x + f(y)) = f(x) + y`, we get `f(0 + f(y)) = f(0) + y = y`. Also we get `f(f(y)) = y` by setting `x=0`. Thus `f(f(0)) = f(0)`, so expression 8.
<missing 31>: Thus if f(f(x)) = x, f is bijective, and we get `f(0)=0`. Applying the injective property, `f(0)=0` can give `0 = f(0)`, which is expression 39.
<missing 32>: Given that `x = f(-f(-x))`, and replacing x with -x gives `-x = f(-f(x))`. Applying f on both sides gives `f(-x) = f(f(-f(x))) = -f(x)`, therefore, `f(-x) = -f(x)`. Applying the inverse function `f^{-1}(-x) = -f^{-1}(x)`. We know that `f(-x) = -f^{-1}(x)` which corresponds to expression 37.
<missing 33>: Applying $f$ to the equation $f(-f(-x)) = x$ gives $f(x) = -f^{-1}(-x)$. We know that $f(-x) = -f^{-1}(x)$ hence $-f(x) = -f^{-1}(-x)$, and so $f(x) = f^{-1}(-x)$ and $-f(x) = f^{-1}(x)$. Thus from $f(x+f(y)) = f(x)+y$ or $f(f(x)+y) = x+f(y)$, we can deduce $f(-x) = -f^{-1}(x)$ which corresponds to expression 37.
<missing 34>: Mapping relation `-x' - u \to -x \to -x'` which is expression 34.
<missing 35>: It is either `f(x+f(y)) = f(x)+y` or `f(f(x)+y) = x+f(y)`. So it should be expression 35.
<missing 36>: Setting `y = -f(x)` in P(x,y), we get `P(x, -f(x))` which is expression 36.
<missing 37>: From `f(-f(-x))=x`, we have `f(-x) = -f^{-1}(x)`. Replacing $x$ by $-x$, we get `f(x) = -f^{-1}(-x)`. Using `-x = f(-f(x))`, then $f(-x) = -f^{-1}(x)$, which is expression 37.
<missing 38>: From $x + f(-f(x))=0$, substituting $x$ by $-x$, we get $-x + f(-f(-x)) = 0$, so $-x + f(x) = 0$ and thus, we must have `x + f(-f(x)) = 0` so `0 \sim x + f(-f(x))` which is expression 38.
<missing 39>: From $f(-f(-x))=x$ and $f(-x) = -f^{-1}(x)$. Therefore $f$ is a bijection. $f$ being a bijection follows directly from $f(f(x))=x$ but we haven't shown that for the general case, so we can pick `x=0` which is expression 39.
<missing 40>: The inverse is denoted `f^{-1}` which is expression 6.
<missing 41>: Since `f(-x) = -f^{-1}(x)`, then `f^{-1}(-x) = -f(x)`. Rearranging (2) after replacing x with -x, gives `f(-x) = -f^{-1}(x)`. Thus `f^{-1}(x) = -f(-x)`. Then `x = -f^{-1}(-f(-x))` by replacing $x$ by $-f(-x)$. Also, `f^{-1}(-x) = -f(x)`. Now, we replace `x` with `-x` to obtain, `f^{-1}(x) = -f(-x)`. Then from `f(-f(-x))=x`, we have `x = f(-f(-x))` and `f(-x)=-f^{-1}(x)`. So `x = f(f^{-1}(x))` which is equivalent to `f(f(x))=x` and thus `f^{-1}(x)=f(x)`. Thus we have `x + y \sim x' + y' + u` which is expression 41
<missing 42>: `g(x) = f(x) + f(-x) = f(x) - f^{-1}(x)`, and we want to show there are at most 2 values for g(x). However, we cannot conclude that `g(x) = 0` at this stage, so the correct one should be `g(x) = f(x) + f(-x) = f(x) - f^{-1}(x)` which is expression 24.
<missing 43>: Here we are defining that `x = f(-f(x))`, which is expression 43.
<missing 44>: We define `(x, u)` which is expression 44.
<missing 45>: This defines `x' = f^{-1}(x)` which is expression 45
<missing 46>: `x+y` which is expression 46.
<missing 47>: Using the mapping diagrams: `(x, u) : x' -> x -> x' + u`, `(y, v) : y' -> y -> y' + v`. Then `(x+y, u+v): x'+y' -> x+y -> x'+y'+u+v`. By applying P(-x'-u, x+y), `P(x+y, -x'-u)` which corresponds to expression 47.
<missing 48>: Here we have $x+f(y)$ for the function where `f(x) = \lfloor x \rfloor - \{x\}`, so $x+f(y) =  \lfloor x \rfloor + \{x\} + \lfloor y \rfloor - \{y\} =  (\lfloor x \rfloor + \lfloor y \rfloor) + (\{x\} - \{y\})$ which corresponds to expression 48
<missing 49>: We have `y' = f^{-1}(y)` which is expression 49.
<missing 50>: Box. The mapping diagrams have been introduced before this step to explain the flow of the arguments.
<missing 51>: The mapping from x+y to x'+y'+v corresponds to `x + y \sim x' + y' + v` which is expression 51.
<missing 52>: This leads to `y \sim y' + v - u` which is expression 52
<missing 53>: This is stating that there are at most 2 values, so we are looking for `c=2` which is expression 53.
<missing 54>: The equation should state either f(x+f(y)) = f(x)+y or f(f(x)+y) = x+f(y). The form shown `f(x) + y = x + f(y) = \lfloor x \rfloor + \lfloor y \rfloor` means that f(x) = x and thus g(x)=0, but that is incorrect. The mapping relation must correspond to one of the forms, so the correct answer is 54.
<missing 55>: The mapping diagram `y' \to y \to y' + v` corresponds to 55.
<missing 56>: We know that `x+f(-f(x))=0` so, `0 = f(0) = x + f(-f(x))` which corresponds to expression 56.
<missing 57>: This means that we must have `\{x\} = \{y\}` which is expression 57.
<missing 58>: We know that `f(x_1) + x_2 \sim f(x_2) + x_1`. However, in this specific case, it is `f(x_2) + x_1 = f(x_2) + x_2`, which is expression 58.
<missing 59>: The mapping from f(x) + y to x + f(y) can be expressed as `x + f(y) \to f(x) + y`, which corresponds to expression 59.
<missing 60>: The function defined is `f(x) = \lfloor x \rfloor - {x}` which is expression 60
<missing 61>:  The floor is represented by `\lfloor x \rfloor` which is expression 61.
<missing 62>:  The term in the mapping diagram is `y'` which corresponds to 62.
