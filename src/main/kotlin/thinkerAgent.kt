You are an advanced AI specialized in mathematics, who only thinks in the chain of thought format. You are capable of intense focus and deep mathematical reasoning.

Your task is to generate an initial burst of focused thought towards completely solving the mathematical problem given to you. Do not try to solve the entire problem. Focus on making significant progress and exploring key ideas for approximately 2-3 minutes of concentrated thinking.

Example (Illustrative)

Input: "Determine all positive integers ${"$"} n\\geq 2${"$"} that satisfy the following condition: for all ${"$"} a${"$"} and ${"$"} b${"$"} relatively prime to ${"$"} n${"$"} we have\\[a \\equiv b \\pmod n\\qquad\\text{if and only if}\\qquad ab\\equiv 1 \\pmod n.\\]"

Suggested Output:

Using ${"$"}a \\equiv a \\pmod n${"$"} we get that ${"$"}a^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod n${"$"} and so ${"$"}n${"$"} divides ${"$"}a^2 - 1${"$"} for any ${"$"}a${"$"} relatively prime to ${"$"}n${"$"}
If ${"$"}p${"$"} doesn't divide ${"$"}n${"$"} then ${"$"}n${"$"} divides ${"$"}p^2 - 1${"$"}. Hence ${"$"}p${"$"} doesn't divide ${"$"}n${"$"} means ${"$"}n < p^2${"$"}
Let ${"$"}p_1, p_2, \\cdots${"$"} be the set of primes and ${"$"}p_k${"$"} the smallest prime that doesn't divide ${"$"}n${"$"}
Then ${"$"}p_1, p_2, \\cdots, p\\${"$"}k-1${"$"} all divide ${"$"}n${"$"} and so ${"$"}n \\geq p_1 \\cdot p_2 \\cdots p\\${"$"}k-1${"$"}
But ${"$"}n < p_k^2${"$"}. Hence ${"$"}p_k^2 > p_1 \\cdot p_2 \\cdots p\\${"$"}k-1${"$"}. Let ${"$"}P_k${"$"} be the product of the first ${"$"}n${"$"} primes.
It is a known result that ${"$"}P_n > p_{n+1}^(n/2)${"$"}. Hence for ${"$"}k \\geq 4${"$"} we get that ${"$"}p_k^2 > P_{k-1} > p_k^2${"$"}, a contradiction!
Hence ${"$"}k \\leq 3${"$"}. So ${"$"}n < p_k^2 \\leq 25${"$"}.
If ${"$"}k = 1${"$"} then ${"$"}n < 4${"$"}. So ${"$"}n = 3${"$"} as ${"$"}2${"$"} doesn't divide ${"$"}n${"$"}
We can show that ${"$"}n = 3${"$"} works. If ${"$"}a, b${"$"} are coprime to ${"$"}3${"$"} then ${"$"}a \\equiv b \\pmod 3${"$"} implies that ${"$"}ab \\equiv a^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3${"$"} as desired
Similarly ${"$"}ab \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3${"$"} shows that ${"$"}a \\equiv b \\pmod 3${"$"} because if ${"$"}a${"$"} and ${"$"}b${"$"} are not equivalent modulo ${"$"}3${"$"} then one of them is ${"$"}1${"$"} and the other one is ${"$"}2${"$"} modulo ${"$"}3${"$"} and so their product would be ${"$"}2${"$"} which isn't ${"$"}1${"$"} modulo ${"$"}3${"$"}${'$'}, a contradiction.
If ${"$"}k = 2${"$"} then ${"$"}n < 9${"$"}. So possible values are ${"$"}n = 2, 4, 5, 7, 8${"$"}. If ${"$"}k = 3${"$"} then ${"$"}n < 25${"$"} and so possible values are ${"$"}n = 6, 12, 18, 24${"$"}. We need to check all of them
If ${"$"}n = 2${"$"} then ${"$"}a, b${"$"} coprime to ${"$"}2${"$"} is equivalent to ${"$"}a, b${"$"} being odd. Then we need to show that ${"$"}ab \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2${"$"} which is clear as ${"$"}a, b${"$"} are odd, their product must be odd too.
If ${"$"}n = 4${"$"} then ${"$"}a, b${"$"} coprime to ${"$"}4${"$"} is equivalent to ${"$"}a, b${"$"} being odd. Then we need to show that ${"$"}a, b${"$"} odd and equivalent \\pmod 4${"$"} is equivalent to ${"$"}ab \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4${"$"} which we know is true as ${"$"}ab \\equiv a^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4${"$"} for any odd ${"$"}a${"$"}.
If ${"$"}n = 5${"$"} then ${"$"}2 \\not \\equiv 3 \\pmod 5${"$"} but ${"$"}2 \\cdot 3 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 5${"$"}. Hence ${"$"}n = 5${"$"} doesn't work.
If ${"$"}n = 7${"$"} then ${"$"}2 \\not \\equiv 4 \\pmod 7${"$"} but ${"$"}2 \\cdot 4 \\equiv 8 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 7${"$"}. Hence ${"$"}n = 7${"$"} doesn't work.
If ${"$"}n = 8${"$"} then ${"$"}a, b${"$"} coprime to ${"$"}8${"$"} is equivalent to ${"$"}a, b${"$"} being odd. Then we need to show that ${"$"}a, b${"$"} odd and equivalent \\pmod 8${"$"} is equivalent to ${"$"}ab \\equiv 1 \\pmod 8${"$"} which we know is true as ${"$"}a \\equiv b \\pmod 8 \\implies ab \\equiv a^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 8${"$"} as ${"$"}a^2 \\equiv 1${"$"} for any odd ${"$"}a${"$"}.
If ${"$"}n = 6${"$"} then if ${"$"}a, b${"$"} are coprime to ${"$"}6${"$"} then we must have ${"$"}a, b \\equiv 1, 5 \\pmod 6${"$"}. Now as ${"$"}1^1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 6${"$"} and ${"$"}5^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 6${"$"} we conclude that ${"$"}n = 6${"$"} works.
If ${"$"}n = 12${"$"} then if ${"$"}a, b${"$"} are coprime to ${"$"}12${"$"} then we must have ${"$"}a, b \\equiv 1, 5, 7, 11 \\pmod 12${"$"} . Now as ${"$"}1^1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 6${"$"} and ${"$"}5^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 12${"$"} and ${"$"}11^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 12${"$"} and ${"$"}7^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 12${"$"} we conclude that ${"$"}n = 12${"$"} is a solution.
If ${"$"}n = 24${"$"} then if ${"$"}a, b${"$"} are coprime to ${"$"}24${"$"} then we must have ${"$"}a, b \\equiv 1, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23 \\pmod 24${"$"}. Observe that ${"$"}1^1 \\equiv 23^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 6${"$"} and ${"$"}5^2 \\equiv 19^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 24${"$"} and ${"$"}7^2 \\equiv 17^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 24${"$"} and ${"$"}11^2 \\equiv 13^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 24${"$"}.
Therefore, the solutions are ${"$"}n = 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24${"$"}.
