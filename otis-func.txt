Definition 1.1. Throughout this entire unit, "solve over $K$ " means to find all functions $f: K \rightarrow K$ such that the equation holds for all choices of values of the variables chosen from $K$.

## ยง1.1 Cauchy's functional equation

Pay particular attention to Cauchy's equation, if you are new - that's a common tripping point.

Just to clear up some terminology confusion:
Definition 1.2. Let $h: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be a function. We say $h$ is

- bounded if there's a constant $C$ such that $|h(x)| \leq C$ for all $x \in \mathbb{R}$;
- bounded above if there's a constant $C$ such that $h(x) \leq C$ for all $x \in \mathbb{R}$;
- bounded below if there's a constant $C$ such that $h(x) \geq C$ for all $x \in \mathbb{R}$.

Let $I \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ be an interval. We say $h$ is "bounded over $I$ ", "bounded above over $I$ ", "bounded below over $I$ ", if the above properties hold with "for all $x \in \mathbb{R}$ " replaced by "for all $x \in I$ ".

This is mostly used in the context of Cauchy's functional equation. Reproducing the theorem from The OTIS Excerpts:

Theorem 1.3 (Cauchy + missing any disk $\Longrightarrow$ linear, see https://w.wiki/8nN5)
Suppose $f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ satisfies $f(x+y)=f(x)+f(y)$. Then $f$ is linear if any of the following are true:

- $f$ is continuous over any nontrivial interval (i.e. an interval of positive length).
- $f$ is bounded (either above or below) over any nontrivial interval.
- There exists $(a, b)$ and $\varepsilon>0$ such that $(x-a)^{2}+(f(x)-b)^{2}>\varepsilon$ for every $x$ (i.e. the graph of $f$ omits some disk, however small). This criteria subsumes the first two, so you can remember just this bullet.

Remark. On the other hand, $f(q x)=q f(x)$ for any $q \in \mathbb{Q}$ holds automatically when $f$ satisfies the Cauchy equation, with no additional hypothesis. You should be able to prove this yourself.

## CAUCHY'S EQUATION DOES NOT IMPLY LINEAR OVER $\mathbb{R}$ !

For BFW-fneqn, if you obtain the Cauchy FE and then directly conclude $f$ is linear without explanation, I will automatically reject your unit submission and make you re-submit it.

To re-iterate, examples of valid ways to prove that $f$ are linear include:

- The domain of the functional equation is $\mathbb{Z}$ or $\mathbb{Q}$.
- Using the theorem above; if so, explain why the hypothesis applies.
- Doing some other manipulations or work to obtain that $f$ is linear (i.e. not quoting anything and proving it manually).


## ยง1.2 Do not use unsolicited continuity unless you know what you're doing

If you are an FE beginner, I suggest deleting the word "continuous" from your head unless the problem statement specifically tells you the unknown function $f$ is continuous (in which case they probably want you to quote the earlier theorem) or polynomial.

With a small number of exceptions (like, less than five or so problems Evan has seen lifetime ${ }^{1}$ ), you should almost never be trying to use continuity on an unknown function unless the problem statement actually outright has the word "continuous" in it (or "polynomial"). So, the following are all classic newbie mistakes:

- Trying to prove the unknown function $f$ is continuous without any sort of inequality.
- Assuming without proof the unknown function $f$ is continuous.
- Trying to use continuity to deal with a pointwise trap ("I got to $f(x)^{2}=x^{2}$ so now I just need to show $f$ is continuous to get $f(x)=x$ or $f(x)=-x$, right?" $\left.{ }^{2}\right)$.
- First proving the functional equation when the unknown function $f$ is continuous (or polynomial, linear, etc.) and then trying to reduce the general case to this easier special case.

When I see any of these, I immediately think to myself, "oh, this student has absolutely no idea what they're doing". It simply doesn't work, and usually it's utterly hopeless for adapting to the general case. (In fact, in many FE's, the easiest way to prove $f$ is continuous is to first solve the problem completely, and then comment that all the answers happen to be continuous functions.)

This advice only applies to general unknown functions $f$. Continuity of an explicit expression is fair game and does happen occasionally. For example, if you have the equation $f$ (stuff) $=2^{x}+y^{8}$, you can use continuity of the expression $2^{t}$ and $t^{8}$ to conclude that $f$ takes on every positive real number. But it would be a mistake to try and deduce $f$ is continuous.

## ยง2.1 Walkthroughs

[^0]Example 2.1 (Indian Postal Set 2016)
Determine all functions $f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ satisfying

$$
f(x f(y)-y f(x))=f(x y)-x y
$$

for all real numbers $x$ and $y$.
Walkthrough. Standard opening moves:
(a) Guess at least one solution to the functional equation.
(b) Plug stuff in to get $f(0)=0$.
(c) Prove that $f(t)=t$ if $t \geq 0$.

The next part is more involved. Let $c=f(-1)$ in the following parts.
(d) Guess another solution to the functional equation other than the one in (a).
(e) Compare $(x, y)=(t,-1)$ and $(x, y)=(-1, t)$ to compute $f(-t)$ in terms of $c$ and $t$.
(f) Finish up and show the solutions you guessed in (a) and (d) are the only ones possible.

## Example 2.2 (ELMO 2014/1, mine)

Find all triples $(f, g, h)$ of injective functions from the set of real numbers to itself satisfying

$$
\begin{aligned}
f(x+f(y)) & =g(x)+h(y) \\
g(x+g(y)) & =h(x)+f(y) \\
h(x+h(y)) & =f(x)+g(y)
\end{aligned}
$$

for all real numbers $x$ and $y$.
Walkthrough. This is a system of functional equations. So, just like we eliminate variables from a system of equations, we will try to eliminate functions from our system.
(a) Find first all (injective) linear solutions. (One approach: show first that if $f, g, h$ are linear then the slopes are all 1.)
(b) Let $a=f(0), b=g(0), c=h(0)$. Show that

$$
f(x+a)=g(x)+c
$$

and similarly. This allows one to rewrite any function in terms of the others.
(c) Use (b) to rewrite $f(x+f(y))=g(x)+h(y)$ in terms of only the function $f$ and the constants $a, b, c$.
(d) Use the cancellation trick on the result in (c). Deduce that $f(x) \equiv x+a$.
(e) Show that the functions you found in (a) were the only ones.
